# QuickSilver
is a single page web application designed to help front-end web developers rapidly prototype web components and see changes made to them on the fly. Users can also import Javascript, CSS, and HTML into the app, as well as export their code to a Zip file containing their code as well as a pre-written React JSX component with the HTML injected into it.
Menus are draggable and resizable and the results of the user generated code can be toggled between a desktop and a mobile version.
